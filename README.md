# IPM15K

## Introduction

Tampered images can easily be used for illegal
activities, such as fake propaganda and reporting false news for
political purposes. This can lead to negative impacts on society.
With the improvement and development of Artificial Intelligence
(AI), image manipulation technology has also been further
improved, more and more retouching software in daily life adopts
AI technology. Compared with the traditional means of image
manipulation, the new image manipulation technology not only
process images conveniently and quickly, but also improve the
quality of image manipulation, the modified images could easily
evade to our naked eyesâ€™ recognition, which presents a more
serious challenge to the field of image forensics. So far there is
no AI-based tampered dataset. Most scholars propose that the
lack of authentic datasets seriously affects the development of
image forensics field. To address this challenge, we proposed a
dataset-IPM15K. It uses the most advanced image processing
technology and contains a total of 150,00 doctored vital images.
This dataset also could serve as a catalyst for progressing many
vision tasks, e.g., localization, segmentation, and alpha-matting,
etc.

## Example

Examples of our proposed dataset, which is a novel
dataset based on AI technology. These images are made by
pixel-level target extraction and pasting to the host image. If
no corresponding MASK is available, can you find out where
the image is tampered with?
